Description: This package provides functions for estimation of mixed-effects models using stochastic differential equations. Moreover it provides functions for finding smoothed estimates of model states and for simulation. The setup allows for any multivariate linear time-invariant model to be specified, and it also handels multidimentional input, co-variates, missing observations and specification of dosage regimen.
